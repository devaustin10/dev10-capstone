            <p><strong>LogOut Hiking</strong> was created to encourage users to explore nature.
                <br></br>We enabled sharing in hopes that this will allow users to connect to other hikers near them,<br></br> 
                as well as to see others' experiences and find new trails. <br></br>
                <br></br>We are currently building features to bookmark hike entries the user enjoys, for easy access later.</p><br></br>
            <p>Please reach out to us at getOut@LogOut.com for any features you would like to see added,<br></br> or any errors you experience while using our app.</p>
